# This repository is to organize the questions and information being gathered to integrate ASpace and ICE. It replaces the gist created earlier and included in this repo.

# How to use:
- Questions go in the [issues](https://github.com/SteelsenS/ASpace_Questions/issues) area
- Resolved information goes into the [pages](https://steelsens.github.io/ASpace_Questions) section- which should allow for this to be referenced easily into the future and to track changes
